# **AI POWERED CRIME ANALYSIS AND PREDICTION ENHANCING DECISION MAKING WITH ML AND TIME SERIES**
#### Abstract:  Artificial Intelligence (AI) plays a crucial role in analyzing and predicting indicators, enhancing management and operational efficiency. Digitized data from various sectors help optimize decision-making and strategy development. Currently, due to resource limitations and legal and data security challenges in the country of residence, collecting real-world data remains difficult. Therefore, the project focuses on crime analysis and forecasting using a simulated dataset from Los Angeles (2010â€“2019) to validate the effectiveness of AI methods. Algorithms such as Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Logistic Regression, KNN, Naive Bayes, and Voting Classifier are applied to structured data, while ARIMA, SARIMA, Prophet, and LSTM are used for time series forecasting. LSTM has demonstrated superior performance in predicting crime trends.Experimental results show that Gradient Boosting and Voting Classifier achieve over 85% accuracy, while Prophet and LSTM maintain a forecast error below 10% in areas with clear cyclical patterns. This system enhances crime prevention capabilities, optimizes resource allocation, and provides valuable insights for decision-making.Despite promising results, the research faces challenges related to real-world data availability, computational resources, and security concerns. Improving the models and expanding their applications will be the next steps in optimizing AI in this field.
### I. Machine learning (ML) is essential for crime prediction by analyzing structured data such as location, time, crime type, and victim demographics. Various ML algorithms, including Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Logistic Regression, KNN, Naive Bayes, and Voting Classifier, have been applied to classify and predict crime occurrences. Experimental results indicate that Gradient Boosting and Voting Classifier achieve over 85% accuracy, making them reliable for crime classification. These models help law enforcement agencies allocate resources effectively and anticipate crime patterns.

#### II.Time series forecasting is crucial for predicting future crime trends based on historical data. Methods such as ARIMA, SARIMA, Prophet, and LSTM are commonly used to analyze crime patterns over time.LSTM has demonstrated superior performance in capturing long-term dependencies and complex crime trends. Prophet and SARIMA also show strong predictive capabilities, with Prophet achieving forecast errors below 10% in areas with clear cyclical crime patterns.

#### III. Crime analysis leverages both ML and time series forecasting to enhance decision-making for law enforcement and urban planning. By identifying high-risk areas and predicting crime surges, authorities can deploy resources proactively. This approach improves crime prevention strategies, optimizes resource allocation, and provides insights for decision-making. However, challenges remain regarding real-world data availability, computational resources, and security concerns. Future improvements will focus on refining models and expanding applications.
